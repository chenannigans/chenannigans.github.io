	<h4>Principal Financial Group <br> Des Moines, IA</h4>
	<h5>Summer 2015 | IT Application Development Intern</h5>

	<p> Sophomore year I decided to go a bit out of my comfort zone and fly to the midwest to live in a state I had previously only known for corn. Although somewhat of a culture shock, the city is really quite nice with even nicer people, great food, and low living cost to boot.</p>

	<p> Despite being a company I hadn't heard much about on the east coast, Principal is one of Des Moines' biggest employers and has considerable influence internationally. The internship program was well organized and I got to work on a great project with some really smart people. I worked on front-end development for the RIS (Retirement and Investment Services), where I learned more about 401k plans than anyone my age could have dreamed of. Even though I was an intern, I was tasked with recoding the deferral selection page, which was to be used by millions of people.

	 <p> During the intern hackathon, I also built a calendar invite app to help recruiters schedule appointments with candidates. </p>


	 <p>Summer Tech Stack: <br> Backbone, Underscore, Dust.js, EdgeUI (Bootstrap mod), Bootstrap, Grunt, Firebase</p>
