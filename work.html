			<h4>Capital One <br> Richmond, VA</h4>
			<h5>Summer 2016 | Software Engineering Intern</h5>

			<p> This summer I worked at Capital One's gorgeous West Creek site, which actually looks and feels more like a college campus than my university does! </p>

			 <p> I was part of the Consumer Identity</b> department and worked on front-end for an open-source project that verifies customers using Capital One's login credentials. I primarily prototyped modals using Angular and the in-house Bootstrap mod, both of which were fairly new to me and provided great learning experiences. I was also exposed to the wonders of Gulp (though not too far from Grunt, which I used last year) and BrowserSync, which streamlined development considerably. A highlight of the summer was the intern Carbon hackathon, which was a lot of fun! More information on that project can be found <a href = "projects.html#giftr">here</a>.</p>

			 <p> Till the end I was reminded that effective utilization of tech can improve banking immensely, which Capital One is certainly making strides towards. I was impressed by and glad to be part of their mission to insource tech talent, focus on open source solutions, and engage in community outreach (I got to teach MIT App Inventor to middle and highschoolers, which was a ton of fun). I can only hope that other older financial institutions follow their lead and consider technology as a larger asset. 

			 <p>Summer Tech Stack: <br> Angular, Node, Bootstrap, Materialize, OneUI, Angular-translate, Gulp, Bower, Django</p>

				<h4>Principal Financial Group <br> Des Moines, IA</h4>
				<h5>Summer 2015 | IT Application Development Intern</h5>

				<p> Sophomore year I decided to go a bit out of my comfort zone and fly to the midwest to live in a state I had previously only known for corn. Although somewhat of a culture shock, the city is really quite nice with even nicer people, great food, and low living cost to boot.</p>

				<p> Despite being a company I hadn't heard much about on the east coast, Principal is one of Des Moines' biggest employers and has considerable influence internationally. The internship program was well organized and I got to work on a great project with some really smart people. I worked on front-end development for the RIS (Retirement and Investment Services), where I learned more about 401k plans than anyone my age could have dreamed of. Even though I was an intern, I was tasked with recoding the deferral selection page, which was to be used by millions of people.

				 <p> During the intern hackathon, I also built a calendar invite app to help recruiters schedule appointments with candidates. </p>


				 <p>Summer Tech Stack: <br> Backbone, Underscore, Dust.js, EdgeUI (Bootstrap mod), Bootstrap, Grunt, Firebase</p>

	<h4>Green America<br> Washington, DC</h4>
	<h5>Summer 2014 |  Green Business Network Intern</h5>

	<p> Here I decided to pursue one of my long time interests, environmentalism! Green America is a small non profit located on DC's lobbying street, staffed by passionate advocates for the planet. I helped by researching good environmental practices to justify their green business certification assignments, editing some basic HTML, maintaining Lime surveys, and updating which businesses were displaying the appropriate certification seal. 

		<p> A very interesting look into how nonprofits operate: with few resources and a great deal of passion and motivation. Working in a smaller organization also increases individual impact, which is refreshing. </p>
