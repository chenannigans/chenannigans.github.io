        <h4>
            Introduction
        </h4>
        <p>
            Muni is San Franciscoâ€™s primary public transit system - a chaotic mix of buses, light rail trains, and
            iconic cable cars that serves around 500,000 commuters and visitors daily.
        </p>
        <p>Although most local riders use the Clipper Card to get around, the Muni Mobile app is an alternate option for
            buying different types of tickets, planning trips, and viewing general transit information. In the beginning
            of 2024 Muni sunsetted its old app and launched a new one in promise of fixing its notoriously frustrating
            predecessor, but to similarly negative reviews.
        </p>
        <p>For this project, the refreshed design is intended to have a more modern look integrating a seamless ticket
            purchasing and usage
            flow, as well as provide a
            new onboarding experience to help first time users.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
            I started by combing the reviews to investigate common pain points and patterns.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row padding">

    </div>
    <div class="row muni">
        <p>
            <br>Technical issues aside, these were some of the recurring themes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Confusing</b> for visitors and first time users</li>
            <li>UI is outdated and <b>difficult to read</b> </li>
            <li>The ticket purchasing flow has <b>too many steps</b></li>
            <li>Showing a ticket (e.g. to fare enforcement and gate agent) <b>takes too long</b></li>
            <li>You <b>cannot reorder</b> previously purchased tickets</li>
            <li>App should <b>prioritize ticketing function</b></li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        You can map some of the users' complaints to the screenshots below:

                Even the most seasoned San Franciscan would have trouble identifying these icons - many of which are not
                part of the Muni system

                old tickets.</p>

            <p>You aren't able to see any of the other ticket types once you select from the dropdown. Not to mention

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>The overarching sentiment was that most users prioritized <b>efficiency</b>, <b>accessibility</b>, and
            <b>clarity</b>, especially regarding the ticketing features.

    <div class="row">
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>
            Based on the reviews, old screens, and user research, the features I prioritized adding an
            <b>onboarding flow</b> in addition to <b>streamlining the ticket purchasing and viewing experience</b>, in
            addition to making the branding overall more <b>playful</b> and<b> modern.</b>

        </p>
        <h5>Visual Language</h5>
        <p>For the colors and tone of the app, I stayed consistent with the Muni branding and colors by using its
            striking
            and recognizable bold red, combining it with the character of the city's iconic cable cars to create a more
            levity in its presentation. For accessibility purposes, I maintained high contrast between the text and
            background since the app would likely be used in all lighting scenarios.

        <h5>Onboarding Experience</h5>
        <p>Since the vast majority of locals are most familiar with and use the Clipper card to get around, many of the
            app's users are often first time visitors from out of town. <b>Thus, I wanted to create a simple onboarding
                flow
                to make Muni Mobile more accessible and approachable.</b>
        </p>

        <p>I initially experimented with creating a flow based on questions - such as asking if it was their first time
            in San Francisco and how long they planned to stay for. The intention behind this was to surface guidance
            for travel - for example, that Muni offers multiple more cost-effective day passes that might not be known
            to visitors.</p>


        <div class="col s12 desc padding">
            <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/onb1.PNG">
            An early prototype of the onboarding screen involving questions to give the user a more tailored experience
            <h6></h6>
        </div>
        <p>However, after mapping it out it felt like it was a lot of unnecessary screens and long paragraphs that would
            quickly be skipped. The information, while important, could just as easily been highlighted or made obvious
            through the app itself.</p>

        <p> After researching existing onboarding experiences, I decided to go with a simple flow highlighting the
            purpose of the app, as well as provide a rudimentary tutorial for navigating the application.</p>


        <div class="row padding">
            <div class="col s3 desc">
                <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/o1.png">

            </div>
            <div class="col s3 desc">

            </div>
            <div class="col s3 desc">
                <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/o4.png">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                The onboarding flow is followed up with a light tutorial to quickly direct the
                user towards the
                features just highlighted.
            </p>

            <div class="row padding">
                <div class="col s3 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/2.0.png">

                </div>
                <div class="col s3 desc">

                </div>
                <div class="col s3 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/2.2.png">

                </div>
                <div class="col s3 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/2.3.png">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p> As a way to ease in new users, a low information dense onboarding and tutorial flow reduces the barrier
                to entry.
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="row">
            <h5>Ticket Viewing and Activation Flow</h5>
            <p>As the majority of users of the Muni Mobile app were using it for its ticketing feature, I prioritized

                making the task of browsing, viewing, and activating tickets as seamless as possible.


            </p>
            <p>In some early iterations below, I tried out different configurations for the best way to display the
                tickets while making
                the distinction between
                how to buy tickets, view current active tickets, inactive tickets, ticket history obvious.

                <br>
                <br> Differentiating the inactive vs active tickets was important - once a user buys a ticket, it needs
                to be activated in order to be used.




            </p>

            <div class="col s12 desc padding">
                <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/ticketproto.png">
                <h6>Wireframes of different ways of displaying the My Tickets tab</h6>

            </div>

            <p>
                I combined elements of these early prototypes, such as separating out the Buy Tickets into its own
                button, increasing the size of the ticket for readability, and placing the use/view ticket button on the
                side of the ticket to be akin to 'tearing' the ticket and increasing space for information.

            </p>

            <div class="row padding">
                <div class="col s4 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/3.0.png">

                </div>
                <div class="col s4 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/3.1.png">

                </div>
                <!-- <div class="col s3 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/3.2.png">

                </div> -->
                <div class="col s4 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/3.33.png">

                </div>

            </div>

            <p>
                Since 'Use Ticket' is an irreversible action with a time expiration, the pop up ensures there is an
                additional action before committing. It also guards against accidentally hitting the button while
                scrolling.

            </p>



            <p>
                After the activation of the ticket, the ticket becomes 'Active', denoted by the Active pill as well as
                the red color on the left of the stub. The action 'Use Ticket' also changes to 'View Ticket', and there
                is an active expiration countdown timer.
            </p>
            <p>
                For viewing past tickets, many users noted that past tickets were not purchasable, a feature which was
                popular in the previous iteration of the app. Here I integrated a quick buy feature from old tickets,
                which takes fewer steps than the default checkout flow. Past tickets are greyed out while retaining the
                action to buy, and also shows if the ticket was 'Used' or 'Expired'</p>

            <div class="row padding">
                <div class="col s4 desc">
                    <img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/muni/3.5.png">

                <div class="col s4 desc">

            </div>
            <p>
                Using the ticket brings you to the ticketing QR code, which is loosely based on existing old school Muni
                ticket stubs. The screen prioritizes maximum contrast so that it can be easily scanned
                by fare enforcement or used in all lighting environments.

            </p>



        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h5>Ticket Purchasing Flow</h5>
            <p>For the ticket purchasing flow, thea <b>'Favorite Tickets'</b> feature was added for easy access
                to
                most the user's commonly used tickets.
                I also gave each ticket type its own tab to simplify viewing the catalog.

                Purchasing the tickets navigates you back to Your Tickets, where the 'New' pill highlights its recent
                purchase.

            <p>Overall it was a challenge translate a deceptively complicated flows into an experience that was easy to
                understand - ticketing, for example, had a lot of nuances
                regarding activation and viewing that would be complicated to new users of the system. In the end,
                focusing on clarity and signaling of new states through color and animation really helped differentiate
                parts of the process.</p>

            <p>Further improvements would involve tackling the trip planning tool, which is clunky enough where I would
                recommend users just switch to Google Maps for. I would also have liked to play more with settings
                regarding accessibility (such as increasing font size), and maybe exploring how to further consolidate
                the ticket purchasing options (though that would require some more insight from Muni ridership
                statistics).</p>


            <p>If the project had a bit more scope, I would want to play with an alternate onboarding experience that
                utilizes an AI Muni companion that would answer questions and direct users through flows within the chat
                system. While adding AI to a relatively small tool might seem like overkill, the near ubiquity of such
                tools might necessitate exploration down the road.</p>
