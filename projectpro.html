		<h4>
			Introduction
		</h4>

		<p>While working at Capital One, our team partnered with the Venture Capital division to streamline some of
			their
			processes.
			The Venture Capital team is constantly searching for emerging companies and technologies to
			research, evaluate, and invest in. However, they relied on decentralized spreadsheets and email chains to
			keep track of complex evaluation processes that hinged on many different parts of the company. Thus, they
			tasked
			our team to create a new <b> platform that would provide a hub to keep track of and consolidate the
				technology
				evaluation
				process </b>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<h4>Role</h4>
		<p>
			I was the sole product designer in addition to being the main front-end developer. Due to
			resource
			and time constraints, we were unable to work with a dedicated design team, so it was a challenging and
			exciting
			opportunity for me to bring the product from research -> conceptualization -> a fully functional product.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h4>Team</h4>
		<p>
			4 people (1 designer/engineer, 2 engineers, 1 product owner)
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>
			Due to the sudden prioritization of the project, we only had a week to show an initial design and prototype,
			so we conducted a condensed research phase.
			Stakeholders from different parts of the company were interviewed to pinpoint our core features revolving
			around 3 types of
			users.
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>User 1: The Venture Team Member</i>
		<p>
			The Venture team member is the primary user of our product. They are the ones creating evaluations and
			bringing them through the different approvals required. At all times they need to see what stage an
			evaluation is in and the steps required to advance it. In the interview, they explained that most of their
			information was stored in google forms and spreadsheets, so we first explored if there were ways to enhance
			their existing workflow without creating an entirely new product. We agreed that they would benefit from a
			more customizable dashboard, and a workflow that was easier to share and follow.</p>

		<i>User 2: The Approver</i>
		<p>
			The evaluation needs to jump through various hoops to be approved at the company level, so certain
			stakeholders are responsible for signing them off at various stages. The approver should be notified when
			they need to take action, have a centralized place to find their assignments, submit documentation, and
			approve or reject an evaluation.
		</p>

		<i>User 3: The Everyday Observer</i>
		<p>Lastly, there are employees at the company who are not directly involved with the Ventures team but are
			curious about the status of evaluations or have evaluations they would like to recommend themselves. Itâ€™s
			important for them to be able to search for existing evaluations, browse the catalog of technologies, and
			potentially request evaluations.</p>

		<br>

		<b>Key Takeaways</b>
		<p>
			The evaluation process had historically been obscured behind disparate spreadsheets, leaving many in the
			dark
			about the state of evaluations at the company.
			We found that <b>transparency</b> and <b>clarity</b> were the most important aspects for our users.
			<br><br>
		</p>

		<p>

			One of the most important takeaways from the interviews is how important it was to keep a history of the
			entire evaluation process. That way, they knew which key people were involved, why something was approved or
			rejected, and provide transparency into an otherwise inaccessible process.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h4>Prototyping</h4>
		<p>
			Mockups and user flows were created using Sketch, Invision, and Capital One's internal design system.

		</p>
		<p>
			Accounting for the quick turnaround required, we wanted to focus on the core features - an evaluation
			request form, a dashboard, and an evaluation timeline page.

		</p>

		<p>
			Wireframes for our starting 3 pages: <br>1. The evaluation intake form where our Venture team can kick
			off the
			process by inputting the details (replacing the Google form used prior) <br>2. The details page for a single
			evaluation, including the steps the evaluation has gone through. <br>3. The dashboard/home page where all
			evaluations and their statuses can be viewed.

	<div class="row">
		<h4>Designs</h4>
		<p>
			For the designs, we stuck to a simple interface leveraging the existing Capital One design
			language combined with
			tools our users were used to (i.e. Google Forms and Sheets). All images below are shown with test data
			on the development site, so please disregard any odd naming conventions.
		</p>
		<!-- 
			<b>All Evaluations </b>
			<br> For viewing all evaluations, I wanted a clean table with clear color coded stages and sortability, with
			options to just see Your Evaluations and with a button to request a new evaluation.
			<div class="imagepad">
				<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/tw/table-clean.png">
			</div> -->

		<b>Home/Dashboard</b>
		<br> For the home page, we wanted hub where users could view their action items, an interactive graph
		overview of all evaluations, and a sortable table showing the stages and details of the evaluations.
		We intended this page to be modular - depending on your role you might see different items - for example,
		only those who need to approve evaluations would be able to see the 'Pending Approvals' section.
		<div class="imagepad">
			<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/tw/edited-dash.png">
		</div>

		<b>Evaluation Details</b>
		<br> After creating a new evaluation or clicking on one from the Dashboard's table, you can view all its
		attributes and a timeline of its creation. The top half gives a rundown of the attributes and also shows
		who's accountable for the technology. This provides the transparency and ownership required for the process
		to move forward.
		On the bottom, the Event Log tells a story of who's reviewed it in the past, what issues they had with it,
		and what its current status is. By surfacing the key people involved in these decisions as well as the
		documentation involved, it provides insights into what has made an evaluation thrive or meet its untimely
		end. At a glance, the light color coding of the circles indicates waiting, approval, and rejection states.

			<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/tw/detail 2.jpg">

		</div>

		<b>Actions</b>
		<br> Depending on your role, different prompts will appear on details page with certain action items. In the
		first
		instance below, the Approver user is prompted to either approve or reject the evaluation request. Going
		through
		this and other flows advances the evaluation - and all the documentation is centralized on this page for
		ease of reference.

		</div>
		<b>Discovery</b>
		<br> To make content accessible, users can access the search feature to find existing evaluations. It's also
		a useful check to make sure duplicate evaluations are not made.
		<div class="imagepad">
			<img class="materialboxed responsive-img" src="img/tw/search.png">
		</div>

		For promoting discoverability, we had another modular dashboard popup to show a trending featured
		technology, bringing awareness to emerging intiatives.

	</div>
	<div class="row">

		<h4>Takeaways</h4>
		<p>The Venture team fully onboarded their portfolio onto our platform and used it to track technologies daily. A
			few months in, we had around 40-50 active evaluations and the team was happy with the centralized tool.
			Outside of the Venture team, other users expressed curiosity and interest in the company's investment and
			integration strategies.

		</p>
		Considering the very short timeline, I was proud of what our team was able to accomplish.
		Functionality was definitely prioritized in this MVP - given more resources I would have liked to do more user
		testing and iterations based on continuous feedback.

		Ideas for further improvements included having more ways to filter the
		evaluations as well as a clearer timeline with animations similar to what you might see in a live deployment /
		pipeline tool.
